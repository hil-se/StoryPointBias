Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.

Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.",0

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Update the open/close epic/versions panel(s)COS:  Went through some variations on design before Martin suggested a 2-story-point fix for the story that is a slight deviation from the current design, but that  a) pulls in hover-X to close version or epic panel b) when a panel is open, there is no left-side sideways text ",0

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Use the startDate in version report calculations# include the startDate for calculations in Version Report - both in the description on the top as well as on the timeline (i.e. timeline starts on the startDate)  # versions without startDate use the previous calculations  # if some stories were completed before the startDate, the ""completed"" line is adjusted at start, but are not included in the trendline calculations, nor do we display time before startDate.

Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Wizard-like Create Board dialogAs Patrick, I want to be guided when creating a board so I don't get lost in the process.

Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date.

Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.

A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Enable GH on OD instances from the Create Project dialogCOS  The user will go through these steps: # Click to create a project # Select Scrum / Kanban # If GreenHopper is NOT installed, display an installation message tailored to the type of instance (BTF/OD) # For OnDemand, click a link to go to MAC and get the license # Once license is purchased, go to welcome page for GH with create project dialog open and scrum/kanban selected  # If user cancels, return to previous page (can create project dialog be open?) # Add analytics events for every step as much as possible  This should use the existing API as provided by the Internal Systems team (meaning we need to open a new page with MAC and they'll need to log in).  # Copy to be provided.

A: it's displayed in all of them if the user has permissions to see it  Q: What if epics are in a version, how are they counted and displayed?

A: it should show issue removed","As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.",0

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Excel export - plan modeAs Patrick, I want to be able to export selected stories to excel straight from GreenHopper so I can easily manipulate them the way I want.

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","diagram of GreenHopper data / how it all worksSuggested by Matt Doar:  https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/GreenHopper+JIRA+Configuration?focusedCommentId=335479270#comment-335479270    e.g. see diagram on this page:  https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Fields+and+Screens",1

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Quick filters should collapse into a ""...

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","As a reviewer I want to have an account so that i can review an article",1

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date.

Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.

Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?  A: (/) When the Version meta data is asked for in GH, it will check to see if it exists in JIRA as well. If so, it will be migrated over.",-1

CoS:    - The dialog consists of three parts:  -- Board type (Scrum, Kanban)  -- Project/Filter (create new project, choose existing, specify saved filter)  -- leftovers: sample data on/off, workflow (JIRA vs GH Simplified)  - this dialog replaces the existing ones present in:  -- create new scrum board  -- create new kanban board  -- create new DIY board  -- the dialog available from the cog menu (incl Manage Boards)  - the ""DIY"" option is removed from the ""Getting Started"" screen as it is effectively obsolete  - if Scrum or Kanban mode is chosen from the ""Getting Started"" screen, then the wizard should start at step 2 (i.e. we already know if it's scrum or kanban)  - the text inviting you to create new project or choose existing on ""Getting Started"" needs rewording so it simply opens the dialog -- remove the two ""1"" and ""2"" things and replace with just ""1"".  - the link to create a sample project should be rewired to use the new wizard and take you directly to creating the project with sample data and workflow options already selected.    (!) Dev Notes (!)    Q: What if there are no existing projects to select?  A: Skip the step to choose and go straight to create new project    Q: What if there are no filters to select from?  A: No option to choose to create from a filter    Q: What if the user has no permissions to create a project?  A: menu link or button disabled; getting started text changes and does not show option to create    Q: For OnDemand, what if the user doesn't have all application permissions to create a project?  A: menu link or button disabled; getting started text changes and does not show option to create    Q: What if there is a large number of existing projects?  A: Drop down is really long    Q: What if there are a large number of filters?  A: Drop down is really long    Q: What if the user does not have permission to see some/all filters?  A: They won't appear in the list    Q: Are selections persisted between board creations?  A: No    Q: Does scrolling through all the panes persist selections?  A: Back / Next through pages should persist selections    Q: Is there proper XSS escaping for filters and projects?  A: Yes    Q: What if the window is resized?  A: Dialog stays the same size    Q: Does the create button disable/spinner after pressed?  A: There is a spinner.    Q: What happens if the operation is cancelled after the create button is pressed?  A: Within the process the dialog just goes away and no board is created. After the final button is pressed the page will reload and go to board, no cancel button.     Q: Has this been checked from plan, work, and report? Manage Boards, Board Configuration, and Getting Started all the same?  A: Link will be in menu for Manage Boards, Plan, Work and Report.     Q: Will the dialog not render properly in some browsers?  A: No, it will always be beautiful.   A2: In JIRA 5.1, 5.2 the dialog has some differences as expected.",-1

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Add an issue to an Epic from JIRA when no other issues have been added to it yetAs Patrick, I want to be able to add an issue to an empty epic when in JIRA so that I can fill it in easily.

If so, do we have a check in place?  A: (/) Dependency on JIRA 6.0+ and the UPM it uses.    Q: How does licensing work? What if GH is unlicensed? Or if a license cannot be obtained from MAC?  A: (/) If no evaluator license can be obtained, the installer will show an error and GH will be unlicensed.    Q: What if a very old version of GH is already installed on the instance?

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","In order to be able to select report options easily, I want a better control to useWhen opening a dropdown menu with a large amount of options, the menu doesn't force the page to scroll.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.",-1

Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Edit startDate of a fixVersion in JIRAAs Patrick, I want to be able to edit startDate for a fixVersion in JIRA so that the experience between GH and JIRA is consistent and not confusing.    h4. Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?  A: (/) When the Version meta data is asked for in GH, it will check to see if it exists in JIRA as well. If so, it will be migrated over.",-1

"As an administrator, I would like to be able to turn on/off the Release Planning feature as a Labs Feature* Surfaced in the GH Labs Configuration tab * Controls the visibility of any Release Planning feature/story ","As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Expose GH defaults as an APICurrently other plugins can't access GH defaults such as Epic Issue Type or default custom field ids, and as a result can't do stuff where this is information is needed.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","As an Admin I want to create Reviewer accounts",1

(!) Dev Notes (!)    Q: What if there are no existing projects to select?  A: Skip the step to choose and go straight to create new project    Q: What if there are no filters to select from?  A: No option to choose to create from a filter    Q: What if the user has no permissions to create a project?

A: Dialog stays the same size    Q: Does the create button disable/spinner after pressed?  A: There is a spinner.    Q: What happens if the operation is cancelled after the create button is pressed?  A: Within the process the dialog just goes away and no board is created. After the final button is pressed the page will reload and go to board, no cancel button.     Q: Has this been checked from plan, work, and report? Manage Boards, Board Configuration, and Getting Started all the same?  A: Link will be in menu for Manage Boards, Plan, Work and Report.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Assign a story to future sprintAs Patrick I want to be able to assign a story to a future sprint so that it's query-able (via sprint id).

"Wizard-like Create Board dialogAs Patrick, I want to be guided when creating a board so I don't get lost in the process.    CoS:    - The dialog consists of three parts:  -- Board type (Scrum, Kanban)  -- Project/Filter (create new project, choose existing, specify saved filter)  -- leftovers: sample data on/off, workflow (JIRA vs GH Simplified)  - this dialog replaces the existing ones present in:  -- create new scrum board  -- create new kanban board  -- create new DIY board  -- the dialog available from the cog menu (incl Manage Boards)  - the ""DIY"" option is removed from the ""Getting Started"" screen as it is effectively obsolete  - if Scrum or Kanban mode is chosen from the ""Getting Started"" screen, then the wizard should start at step 2 (i.e. we already know if it's scrum or kanban)  - the text inviting you to create new project or choose existing on ""Getting Started"" needs rewording so it simply opens the dialog -- remove the two ""1"" and ""2"" things and replace with just ""1"".  - the link to create a sample project should be rewired to use the new wizard and take you directly to creating the project with sample data and workflow options already selected.

A: Dialog stays the same size    Q: Does the create button disable/spinner after pressed?  A: There is a spinner.    Q: What happens if the operation is cancelled after the create button is pressed?  A: Within the process the dialog just goes away and no board is created. After the final button is pressed the page will reload and go to board, no cancel button.     Q: Has this been checked from plan, work, and report? Manage Boards, Board Configuration, and Getting Started all the same?  A: Link will be in menu for Manage Boards, Plan, Work and Report.

Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.

Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.

Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?

Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","As a writer I want to create multiple articles so that they can be published",1

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.",-1

(!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.

Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.",-1

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.

Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date.

Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.

A: (x) Not Answered","As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.",-1

Q: What does the detail view display if a version is selected but no issues are selected? A: There is no selection of a version yet, that's part of the filter story.   Q: What if the fixVersions field doesn't exist? A: (x) Not Answered  Q: Is there a way to select another version field to be displayed here?

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Allow to set resolution in Simplified WorkflowAs Patrick, I want to be able to specify which statuses transitions to which trigger the resolution field to be set to done so that my issues have any resolution at all.

Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?  A: (/) When the Version meta data is asked for in GH, it will check to see if it exists in JIRA as well. If so, it will be migrated over.","In order to be able to select report options easily, I want a better control to useWhen opening a dropdown menu with a large amount of options, the menu doesn't force the page to scroll.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.

(note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show ""type"" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Change visual treatment on issue count in swimlane header to not use AUI badgeSee attached screenshot.

"As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","ADG GH: Resizable Detail View- For this story, Plan Mode only - Idea is that we have a draggable left side for when people need more space, similar to other products (e.g. Confluence). - This drag would be remembered per client (local storage) in terms of percentage of window size - Consider what happens when DV is dragged too far - do other columns collapse or resize - Consider whether we do two-line issue representation for backlog column  Testing notes below",0

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","As an Admin I want to be able to assign roles",1

Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date.

Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Update close icon in Detail View to be a font icon",1

"Edit startDate of a fixVersion in JIRAAs Patrick, I want to be able to edit startDate for a fixVersion in JIRA so that the experience between GH and JIRA is consistent and not confusing.    h4. Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?

Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.

Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date.

A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.

Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?

A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?

"As Patrick, I want to adjust release report projections to simulate and better understand what can be achieved within a version- allow the percentage calculation to be adjusted (default to 10%) ","As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a versionThis is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it.

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.",1
"As Patrick, I want to be able to see more details about the version when looking at the Versions Panel- this refers to the version panel - the behaviour should mimic the epic panel, including the twixies - information needed: description, start date, release date as well as count of total, completed and unestimated stories, total estimate units, small progress bar (startDate is not part of the progress calculation) - for empty data (release date, start date) reuse the same approach as we use on the detail view  ","Edit startDate of a fixVersion in JIRAAs Patrick, I want to be able to edit startDate for a fixVersion in JIRA so that the experience between GH and JIRA is consistent and not confusing.    h4.

(!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?

Unmapped statuses will also display this information (not necessarily the option to change it)  3. During the conversion to simplified workflow, the user will be presented with the default choice of statuses from the ""Done"" column selected for the resolution but should be able to override it before finishing the conversion.

","Edit startDate of a fixVersion in JIRAAs Patrick, I want to be able to edit startDate for a fixVersion in JIRA so that the experience between GH and JIRA is consistent and not confusing.    h4. Approach for JIRA 6.0    JIRA code base:  * Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column  * Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.  * Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it  * Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date  * Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object    GH code base:  * Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.  * Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.  A: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.    Q: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?

(!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the ""predicted"" release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.","Gather information about potential sprint conflictsWhat we want to get out of it:    - 1 for having gh  - amount of rapid boards  - amount of kanban boards  - amount of scrum boards    - amount of sprints  - amount of issues in scrum boards    - amount of issues which belong to multiple sprints  - amount of sprints which contain said issues  - 1 if this instance had problem",1
